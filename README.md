This is OV7670 camera sensor demo project for Tang Nano 9K board.

## Hardware setup
Below you can find main components diagram.

![Components diagram](./doc/images/main_components.drawio.png "Title")

Here we have Tang Nano 9K development board, 4.3'' LCD screen and OV7670 camera sensor.
The whole system powered through USB cable. The fully assembled setup is on the photo.

Here I added 3D-printed plastic holder to hold on all components together and
a simple PCB for interconnect between camera module and Tang Nano board.

You can find OpenSCAD file of plastic holder and STL model [here](physical).
